# Rinse Addon
This addon is very similar to Decursive, it helps with removing debuffs from friendly units. Rinse is optimized for memory usage and also utilizes ![SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) and ![nampower](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower) functions if you have these mods installed.
You can use `/rinse` or `/run Rinse()` in a macro or make a key binding to cleanse without clicking inside GUI.
