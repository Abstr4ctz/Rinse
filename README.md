# Rinse Addon
This addon is very similar to Decursive, it helps with removing debuffs from friendly units. Rinse is optimized for memory usage and also utilizes [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW), [nampower](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower) and [UnitXP_SP3](https://github.com/allfoxwy/UnitXP_SP3) functions if you have these mods installed.<br>
You can use `/rinse` or `/run Rinse()` in a macro or make a key binding to cleanse without clicking inside GUI.

Other commands:<br>
`/rinse options` - open the options GUI to change settings<br>
`/rinse skip` - open the skip list GUI to add or remove units from the skip list<br>
`/rinse prio` - open the priority list GUI to add or remove units from the priority list<br>
